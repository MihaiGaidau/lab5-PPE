<h1> PPE Laboratory Work 5 </h1>
<h2>Title:</h2>
Collaboration. Complex application

## Contents
* Collaboration
* All previously studied things

## Mandatory Objectives
* Create an application which has:
  * Child windows controls
  * GDI animation
* Animation should be controlled by controls

## Objectives With Points
* Work on this project in a team of 2-4 `(2 pt)`
  * Divide tasks and describe them in readme (for each task indicate who is responsible for it) `(1 pt)`
  * Use `pull requests` in order to merge your code `(2 pt)`
* Make it useful (you may be asked (by me) to evaluate the usefulness of your application idea) `(0-3 pt)`
* First create a sketch, then work on code `(1 pt)` _(commit sketches early)_

## App Functionality:
This is a game in which you control the paddle and you goal is to destroy all bricks. If you let the ball fall outside your paddle - you lose the game.
##Tasks 
My task was to draw the bricks and the ball. Also i had to write the code for wall,bricks and player collisions.
Task of my colleague was to write a class for the player controlled paddle.
## Conclusion: 
In this laboratory we learned how to work in a team and divide the tasks between members.
